## Introduction

Pyzify is a small program that does two things:

1. Creates a self-contained and executable Python [zipapp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html) from your Python source code. The resulting binary contains a bootstrap component and a [pyz](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441/) bundle of your application files with all the Python dependencies included. To run, the application **only needs a Python interpreter of the right version on users' computers** &ndash; users don't need to install other Python packages themselves because the binary contains everything it needs. It's almost like a regular compiled program!
2. Bundles the executable application into a zip archive suitable for distribution. The zip archive contains a README file with information about the application; the README is constructed using a pyzify that you supply, letting you customize its contents.

Pyzify is uses [shiv](https://github.com/linkedin/shiv) to do the real work. It adds some bootstrap code to test the version of Python at run-time and additional steps to create the zip archive for distribution.

## Authors and history

Pyzify started as a script used by the author to create self-contained applications for [Handprint](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint) and [eprints2bags](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2bags). It was spun out as its own project late in the year 2021.
